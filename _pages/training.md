The group is on a regular basis involved in running training events, which take the forms of guest lectures on Masters and Ph.D. courses, week-long practical courses, and half-day to two-day workshops. The topics usually relate directly to the [resources](/resources/) that we develop, in particular the STRING database, the Cytoscape stringApp, and text mining.

Below you can find training material as well as lists of upcoming and past events. Feel free to [contact us](mailto:lars.juhl.jensen@cpr.ku.dk), if you are interested in us running or being part of a training event.

## Training material

As part of running recurring training events, we maintain up-to-date exercises on the following topics:

* [STRING database](/training/string/)
* [Cytoscape stringApp](/training/stringapp/)
* [Omics Visualizer](/training/omicsvisualizer/)
* [Text mining](/training/textmining/)
* [Text mining for the Human Biology MSc](/training/textmining/hb/)

You can also find several lectures on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/larsjuhljensen).

Additional training material on other topics is linked to from the events below.
