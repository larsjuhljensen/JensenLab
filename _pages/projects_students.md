We are always looking for Master's students to join the lab to work on projects. All projects are estimated to last between three and six months and basic programming knowledge is required. Please contact us if you are interested in doing a project with us.

## Text mining beyond PubMed

Text mining of the biomedical literature has been successful in extracted interactions between a broad spectrum of biomedical entities. The JensenLab co-develops a range of widely used [resources](/resources/) that catalog association, such as STRING for protein--protein interactions and DISEASES for disease--gene associations. A central component of all resources is the automatic mining of abstracts and open access full-text articles available in PubMed.

[Recent work](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005962) showed that using full-text articles yields considerable improvements compared to PubMed abstracts alone. Motivated by these results, the main focus of this project is to explore resources for text mining beyond PubMed and to study the effect of incorporating additional text sources on the quality of the extracted associations. The quality will be measured by comparing them to a gold standard of expert-curated associations. Potential sources of text include the 10000+ relevant preprints available in bioRxiv, patents available via USPTO, clinical trial records, and proposals of funded research grants.

The project is ideal to get started with co-occurrence-based text mining, improve your skills on the command line for handling and cleaning large data files, and become more proficient in a programming language used for data analysis (such as Python).
